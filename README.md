## ðŸ“– About

This repository is a collection of my learning notes, examples, and experiments using **Gridap.jl** to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** in Julia.

It serves as a practical reference for setting up meshes, defining FE spaces, formulating weak forms, solving problems, and post-processing results â€” all within Juliaâ€™s modern FEM ecosystem.

## ðŸ“š References

This repository is a personal learning collection and does not cover all of Gridap.jlâ€™s capabilities.
