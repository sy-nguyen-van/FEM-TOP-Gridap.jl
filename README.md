## 📖 About

- This repository is a collection of my learning notes, examples, and experiments using **Gridap.jl** to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** in Julia.

- It serves as a practical reference for setting up meshes, defining FE spaces, formulating weak forms, solving problems, and post-processing results — all within Julia’s modern FEM ecosystem.

## 📚 References

- This repository is a personal learning collection and does not cover all of Gridap.jl’s capabilities.

- 📌 **Readers are encouraged to refer to the official Gridap.jl documentation for full details, examples, and advanced usage: [https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl)**.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- **Install Julia:** Download and install from [https://julialang.org/install/](https://julialang.org/install/).  
- **Install Gridap:** Add the `Gridap` package:
  ```julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add("Gridap")
  ```
- **Recommended Environment for Windows users:**  The authors are using Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension for running and editing Julia code interactively.
